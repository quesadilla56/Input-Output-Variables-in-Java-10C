/* Java Variable types
You have five types of variables in Java
Boolean: True/False, only 2 state - boolean
Integers: Int, always whole numbers 
Strings: Text, example "Hello" always between quotations
Float: always decimals, example 19.98 or -19.98
Char: single characters, "a" or "B"
In math you say x=4 it means x=4 
In programming x=4 (x is assigned to 4)

x="patty"
c="cheese"
b="tomato"
d="bread"
e="lettuce"
f="ketchup"
g="mayo"

So here is the template: type variable = value;
